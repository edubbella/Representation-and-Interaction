// Agent z_two in project Zeuthen Strategy.mas2j

//z_two is similar to z_one, and in fact, mostly copied and pasted (including this very text!). There is one important difference:
//A deal, defined as [[list],[list]], consists of two task allocations, one for each agent.
//Z_two uses the RIGHT list as its set, and the left list as Z_one's. You are free to define a deal in other ways, however.
//Depending on how you implement the Zeuthen strategy, you might end up adding functionalities to one agent and not to the other.
//Always make sure that when you copy and paste code from one agent to the other, that you make the necessary adjustments (such as
//switching which side the agent has to use).

//Hint: Jason is not widely used on the internet, so code examples mostly exist
//on the Jason site itself. However, the beliefs are mostly prolog: take examples
//from prolog code, then check on http://jason.sourceforge.net/api/ if their prolog
//equivalents exist.
//Further, you should not need to use the environment/java part of this code.
//You should be able to finish all assignments by adjusting z_one and z_two.

/* Initial beliefs and rules */
//I remember where the post office is.
postoffice(a).

//I remember the following routes and their cost:
//Unless you want to make a graph search algorithm (not recommended),
//these beliefs will likely be unused.
route(a,b,2).
route(a,c,3).
route(b,c,4).
route(b,d,6).
route(b,e,5).
route(e,f,4).
route(c,f,3).

//I know the costs of all sub-tasks. Keep in mind that every possible combination
//is written here: if you want to add more, you will have to write down all
//new possible costs.
//It is recommended to keep lists in alphabetic order. Jason does not see
//[b,c] as the same as [c,b]. This can cause bugs. If necessary, use the function
// .sort(List,SortedList) to make a list[c,b] a sorted list [b,c].
